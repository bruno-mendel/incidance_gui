# Incidence GUI

This project is a MATLAB graphical interface designed to visualize different NACA airfoil profiles and adjust their angle of attack.

## Features

- Selection of airfoil profiles (NACA 0012, NACA 2412, NACA 4412) from a dropdown menu.
- Adjustment of the angle of attack using a slider.
- Graphical display of the selected airfoil profile with rotation based on the angle of attack.
- Dynamic updating of the display when changing selection or angle.

## Prerequisites

- MATLAB installed on your system.
