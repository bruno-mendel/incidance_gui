# Incidence GUI

This project is a MATLAB graphical interface designed to visualize different NACA airfoil profiles and adjust their angle of attack.

## Features

- Selection of airfoil profiles (NACA 0012, NACA 2412, NACA 4412) from a dropdown menu.
- Adjustment of the angle of attack using a slider.
- Graphical display of the selected airfoil profile with rotation based on the angle of attack.
- Dynamic updating of the display when changing selection or angle.

## Prerequisites

- MATLAB installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bruno-mendel/incidance_gui.git

2. Place the naca0012.txt, naca2412.txt, and naca4412.txt files in the same directory as the aero_gui.m script.

## Usage
1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder containing aero_gui.m.
2. Run the script by typing:
    ```bash
    aero_gui

3. In the GUI window that opens:
    -Choose an airfoil profile from the dropdown menu.
    -Use the slider to adjust the angle of attack (between -10° and 10°).
    -Observe the profile displayed in the plot area, updated in real-time.

## Project Structure
aero_gui.m: main script for the graphical interface.
naca0012.txt, naca2412.txt, naca4412.txt: data files containing coordinates for the NACA profiles.
